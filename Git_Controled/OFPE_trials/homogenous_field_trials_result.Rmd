# Objectives: 

+ Run on-farm experiments over years using the same trial design each year, assume homogeneous environment (field and weather).

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/qianqiandu/Desktop/Screenshot\ 2024-03-23\ at\ 5.07.34 PM.png")
```

I also run it with real weather:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/qianqiandu/Desktop/Screenshot\ 2024-03-23\ at\ 4.59.12 PM.png")
```


+ Run APSIM simulations through R, the trials follow OFPE setting- each plot/point received randomly different amount of N rates in each year. Assuming homogeneous plots within fields and fake weather with every year as 2019's weather. 100 plots in this field. 


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/qianqiandu/Desktop/Screenshot\ 2024-03-23\ at\ 5.13.00 PM.png")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/qianqiandu/Desktop/Screenshot\ 2024-03-23\ at\ 5.23.00 PM.png")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/qianqiandu/Desktop/Screenshot\ 2024-03-23\ at\ 5.23.34 PM.png")
```

I also run ofpe with real weather:


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/qianqiandu/Desktop/Screenshot\ 2024-03-23\ at\ 5.51.16 PM.png")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/qianqiandu/Desktop/Screenshot\ 2024-03-23\ at\ 5.51.30 PM.png")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/qianqiandu/Desktop/Screenshot\ 2024-03-23\ at\ 5.52.01 PM.png")
```

## We can see the results below in Rstudio if needed. 
```{r}

consis_trials <- readRDS("/Users/qianqiandu/Desktop/N_Residual_APSIM/Git_Controled/consistent_rate_trials/consistent_rate_trials.rds")

```

```{r}

consis_trials <- readRDS("/Users/qianqiandu/Desktop/N_Residual_APSIM/Git_Controled/OFPE_trials/ofpe_fake_weather.rds")

```


# What's next: 

+ I will, first, do the simulations of yield data for Mona, after clarifying questions about .nc data.

+ Look at the results with NO3.

+ Maybe change the settings of a homogeneous field?
